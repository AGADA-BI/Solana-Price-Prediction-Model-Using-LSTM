# Solana-Price-Prediction-Model-Using-LSTM
Solana Price Prediction using LSTM: A deep learning project leveraging historical Solana price data from 13/07/2020 to 1/10/2024 to forecast future trends with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

#Project Features
##Data Processing: Cleaned and prepared historical Solana price data for training.
##Feature Engineering: Utilized only essential columns for analysis and applied scaling techniques for efficient model training.
##LSTM Model: Built and trained a multi-layer LSTM model to predict Solana's price.
##Visualization: Plotted the training, validation, and predicted prices for clear performance analysis.
